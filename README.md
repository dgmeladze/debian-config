# debian-sway-config

Hello!
This is my own debian sway config.
It's a bit in progress and uses other persons theme and configuration for sway.

But this makes installing sway very easy.

It installs my own setup for developing as web developer.


Work is in progress, so you can write me, what I can make better.
Feel free to use it!
