# debian-sway-config

Hello!
I created this configuration for quickly setting up everything needed on a fresh Debian installation. To get started, you need a minimal Debian installation and Git installed.

The commands are as follows:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/dgmeladze/debian-sway-config
cd debian-sway-config
sudo chmod +x ./install.sh
./install.sh
```

The setup uses a configuration similar to Ubuntu Sway Remix, which I used as a base but modified.

I would appreciate any suggestions for themes and improvements.
You can use this repository to simplify the installation of Sway on your Debian and quickly configure it.

The setup is still under development and testing.
